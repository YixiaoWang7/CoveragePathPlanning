### Toolpath Planning through Reinforcement Learning in Additive Manufacturing
Zig-zag path planning is realized, analyzed and improved, as shown in *ZigZagPath.ipynb*. Newest algorithms with different segmentation algorithms are shown in *toolpath_planning.ipynb*.

Learning algorithms is currently sealed.
